# C&SP HW WEEK 2

### Project 1 : AUDI / Primarchitettura Computational Video Performance
[https://vimeo.com/99348618]

The computational projection shows a changing animation created over a rigid grid of squares that can only be scaled down and rotated. The grid of squares will be changing based on to the vocal/beats of the music. 

Input(Data)| Render|Simulation|Event
------------|------------|------------|------------
Darkness          | color              | square changing size to simulate the frequency/beats/vocal of the music | The dark the external light source, the higher the LED brightness 
Music frequency   | size               |         |       
LED screen        | Rotation angle     |         |       
Vocal             | background color   |         |       
Grid              |                    |         |       

### Project 2 : One Hundred and Eight â€“ Interactive Installation
[https://vimeo.com/16558492]

Each plastic bag is installed on the wall and is automatically inflated and deflated. But when a viewer comes close it instantly reacts by drawing back and tentatively following the movements of the observer. As long as he remains in a certain area in front of the installation it dynamically reacts to the viewer's motion. 

| Input(Data)       | Render   | Simulation  | Event  |
